# Healthcare Patient Insights Dashboard (Power BI + SQL + Excel)
This dashboard explores how medication relates to abnormal test results across age groups. Older adults showed the highest abnormalities, raising questions about treatment effectiveness. Additional visuals offer insights on patient demographics and admission trends.


🗂️ Dataset Used
Simulated patient records with over 50,000 rows

Includes demographics, insurance, conditions, admission details, test results, and medication

📌 Project Summary
Using a detailed healthcare dataset, I created an interactive Power BI report to explore:

💊 Medication correlations with abnormal test results

🧓 Medical condition frequency by age group

🩸 Most common medical conditions by blood type

🧪 Distribution of test result outcomes

🧾 Billing and average length of stay

📊 Trends in admission type, insurance, and gender breakdown

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
Excel – Data cleaning and column creation (e.g. age grouping)

SQL – Filtering, aggregation, and CTEs for deeper insights

Power BI – Data modeling, interactive dashboard building

DAX – Calculated columns and KPIs (e.g. average stay)

Data storytelling – Presenting analytical findings visually

🚀 Learning Goals
This project helped me:

Clean and prep data efficiently in Excel

Use SQL to query patterns in large medical datasets

Build interactive dashboards with accessible visual insights

Practice healthcare-focused analysis and storytelling

Strengthen my understanding of how data supports clinical strategy

🔄 Process Overview
1. 🧹 Data Cleaning in Excel
Grouped ages into segments (Teen, Middle Age, Senior)

Removed excess rows, handled formatting issues

Added “Age Group” and cleaned column values for consistency

2. 📋 SQL Querying & Exploration
Wrote queries to:

Identify most common conditions by blood type

Compare spending trends across age groups

Investigate test result distributions by medication

Used CASE, IN, GROUP BY, and ROW_NUMBER() logic

3. 📊 Power BI Dashboarding
Created card KPIs: patient count, avg billing, avg stay

Designed visual breakdowns using:

Clustered bar charts

Pie charts and donut charts

Tree maps and stacked visuals

Built filters using slicers for Age Group, Gender, Condition

❓ Key Questions Answered
🩸 Which blood types show higher risk for specific conditions?

💊 Do medications correlate with abnormal test results?

🧓 Which age group has the most medical conditions?

🧾 Who incurs the highest billing amounts on average?

🧪 What’s the test result breakdown by medication and gender?
