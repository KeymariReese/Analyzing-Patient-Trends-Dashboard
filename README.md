# Healthcare Patient Insights Dashboard (Power BI + SQL + Excel)
This dashboard explores how medication relates to abnormal test results across age groups. Older adults showed the highest abnormalities, raising questions about treatment effectiveness. Additional visuals offer insights on patient demographics and admission trends.

🗂️ Dataset Used
50,000+ rows of simulated hospital patient records

Includes:
Patient demographics (age, gender, blood type)
Medical condition and medication info
Admission and discharge details
Billing amounts, doctors, hospitals, and test results



📌 Project Summary
Explored healthcare patterns through:
💊 Correlations between medication and abnormal test results
🧓 Medical condition frequency by age group
🩸 Most common conditions based on blood type
🧪 Test result outcomes segmented by gender and medication
🧾 Trends in billing amounts and average length of stay
📊 Breakdown by admission type, insurance provider, and hospital



🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
Excel
Data cleaning and formatting
Grouped age ranges (e.g., Teen, Middle Age)



SQL
Filtering, grouping, and aggregation
CTEs and advanced functions like ROW_NUMBER()



Power BI
Dashboard layout and visualizations
Card KPIs, bar/column charts, tree maps, slicers



DAX
Custom metrics like average stay and cost per age group



Data storytelling
Clear visuals tied to healthcare strategy questions



📁 Files Included
README.md – This file



Healthcare Patient Insights Dashboard.pbix – Power BI file



SQL_queries.sql – All key queries used



healthcare_dataset_set.xlsx – Final cleaned dataset



🚀 Learning Goals
Clean large, multi-column datasets efficiently in Excel

Use SQL to extract trends in real-world health data

Build engaging Power BI dashboards with insights for decision-makers

Practice healthcare-specific data analysis and communication



🔄 Project Workflow
1. 🧹 Excel Data Cleaning
Removed blank or duplicate rows

Standardized column formats (e.g., Gender = "Male" or "Female")

Created a new Age Group column for grouping analysis



2. 🧾 SQL Querying
Analyzed:

Most frequent medical conditions by blood type

Average billing per doctor and hospital

Distribution of abnormal test results by medication

Used:

CASE, IN, GROUP BY, ROW_NUMBER() for logic and insights



3. 📊 Power BI Dashboard
Created KPIs: patient count, avg stay, avg billing

Designed with:

Clustered column charts

Pie and donut visuals

Tree maps and slicers (filters by gender, age group, etc.)

Made visuals interactive and easy to navigate for stakeholders





❓ Questions Answered
🩸 Which blood types show higher risk for specific conditions?

💊 Do medications lead to more abnormal test results?

🧓 Which age groups are most frequently admitted?

🧾 Which groups incur the highest billing costs?

🧪 How do gender and medication relate to test outcomes?
